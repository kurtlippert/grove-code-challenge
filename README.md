[Grove Collaborative](https://github.com/groveco) coding challenge (06/14/2019)  

### The Challenge
See the [repo](https://github.com/groveco/code-challenge)  

### Notes
- Likely wanna use [ArcGIS Geocoding Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-find-address-candidates.htm#), they appear to do it for free (limits TBD)
- They do address (string-format) to coordinates and zip to coordinates which takes care of the AC given by Grove
- There are libs that calc distance b/t coordinates, but the requirements stipulate I roll my own
